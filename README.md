# 📊 Sales Insights for a Regional Retail Chain

## 🧠 Business Case

A retail chain operates across multiple cities and wants to understand:

- 🔥 Which products are driving the most revenue  
- 👥 Which sales reps or regions are under/over-performing  
- 📈 Sales trends over time (seasonal patterns, dips, peaks)  
- 🎯 Where to focus marketing or restocking efforts  

This project aims to clean, explore, and analyze the sales data to help the business make better decisions.
